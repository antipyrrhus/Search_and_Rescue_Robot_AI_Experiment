Search &amp; Rescue Robot

To run, execute one of the four .jar files. Each .jar file contains the same experiment with different settings:

SAR_11.jar - Easy environment, poor AI
SAR_21.jar - Easy environment, good AI
SAR_31.jar - Hard environment, poor AI
SAR_41.jar - Hard environment, good AI

To run the source code directly, run Intro.java. (currently, it is equivalent to executing SAR_41.jar.)
