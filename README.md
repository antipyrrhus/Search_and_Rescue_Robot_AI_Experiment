Search & Rescue Robot Experiment

In disaster recovery, fire and other similar situations, the successful use of robots, including those yet to be developed, depends in part on their ability to traverse unpredictable, often dangerous environments without human assistance and, depending on the situation, on their prudent use of finite resources (e.g. distributing a limited supply of first-aid packages, or using a built-in reservoir of fire extinguisher for use in key areas) for maximum efficiency and minimizing risks of loss.

Furthermore, as robots increasingly take on more prominent roles in search-and-rescue tasks, it becomes vital to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that affect a human’s trust of and reliance upon robots. This is because emergency situations are usually times of vastly increased stress and adrenaline for victims and rescuers alike, and the inclusion of robots possessing requisite task capabilities could potentially ease some of the burdens off human rescuers. At the same time, we must also ensure that the degree of human reliance on robots is commensurate with the robot’s competence and the level of difficulty of the task in question, so as to prevent over-reliance in situations for which the robot may be under-equipped, as well as under-reliance in situations which may be too dangerous or taxing to the human.

Reliance and trust, in the above context, have been broad areas of research in human-robot interaction. In our experiment, we are focused on a subset of this issue, as restricted to a search-and-rescue setting. Our main research questions are threefold:

(1) What impact, if any, does the quality of a robot’s prior performance have on a human’s willingness to delegate “critical tasks” to the robot in the future? For purposes of this experiment, “critical tasks” are defined as those involving rescue efforts in response to an emergency.
(2) What impact, if any, does the difficulty level of the task have on the human’s aforementioned willingness to delegate critical tasks to the robot?
(3) What, if any, interactions exist between (1) and (2)?

To simulate the experiment, execute one of the four .jar files. Each .jar file contains an experiment with different settings:

SAR_11.jar - Easy environment, poor AI;
SAR_21.jar - Easy environment, good AI;
SAR_31.jar - Hard environment, poor AI;
SAR_41.jar - Hard environment, good AI;

To run the source code directly, run Intro.java. (currently, it is equivalent to executing SAR_41.jar.)
